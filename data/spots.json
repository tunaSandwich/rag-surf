      "description": "A secluded right reef break on the Gaviota Coast north of Goleta. Naples is a fickle, walk-in spot that requires a solid west swell to break. At its best, it resembles a quality right point break with occasional long workable lines and hollow sections at low tide. The wave features a vertical drop with short but hollow barrel sections running about 30 yards. Heavy kelp presence and a remote, old-California feel. Tom Curren famously owned a house here. The spot is less crowded than most SB breaks due to the 2-mile walk from Haskell's Beach, but when Naples is on, so are most other spots which are often better.",
      "summary": "Naples is a right reef break on the Gaviota Coast near Santa Barbara. It comes alive on solid West swells (260-280°) with at least 4ft on the buoy; however, long-period energy (>15s) is critical to help the swell wrap around Point Conception. Ideal conditions align with a North wind (offshore) and an incoming low to mid tide. Expect punchier, heavier waves than town spots. Note that NW swells over 300° won't wrap in, and south swells are blocked by the Channel Islands. Best for intermediate to advanced surfers due to shallow reef ledges, heavy kelp, and hollow sections.",

It acts as the primary swell magnet, catching the biggest waves and working on all tides (though high tide can be mushy). It requires a West swell (250-280°); however, swell period is the critical limiter here. Standard long-period rules do not apply: WNW swells with periods >15 seconds feel the bathymetry at Gaviota and refract away from Rincon. The 'sweet spot' is a mid-period (12-14s) swell which allows the energy to penetrate deep enough into the channel to hit the point. It is highly exposed to wind (needs N/NE offshore). Fun fact: steep Summer South swells can occasionally create a rideable left-hander here.",

      "summary": "Rivermouth is the fastest and most hollow section of Rincon, running about 50 yards from the creek mouth to the large white house that marks the transition to the Cove. This is 'the barrel section'—tube rides occur here at low tide when the sand is right. The key variable is rain: after good winter rains, Rincon Creek deposits sand and silt across the cobblestone bottom creating what Conner Coffin describes as 'one huge bank, just absolutely tapered and perfect.' Without rain, the bottom is uneven and waves tend to section off. Even on good days, more than half of the waves that barrel through Rivermouth end up shutting down—it's a gamble. Best on W to WNW swell (260-300°) with period under 15 seconds and low or dropping tide. The easiest paddle-out at Rincon (straight from the creek channel) makes it the most crowded section. NW winds are offshore. Sweet spot is head-high to overhead; at max size (12-15ft), gun riders take over at Indicator and the Rivermouth becomes a speed section for connecting to the Cove.",

This is where Tom Curren developed his legendary style. On an average day, produces knee-to-waist-high waves perfect for longboarding. But during solid W swells, the Cove transforms into a world-class right with rides up to 300 yards. Multiple takeoff spots depending on swell. The wave is so close to perfection that as surf journalist Bill Cleary wrote in 1966, 'maneuvering seems inappropriate, an insult to the dignity of the wave.'",

Produces the smallest but most perfectly tapered waves of the three sections; a head-high wave at Indicator typically becomes waist-high by the time it wraps into The Cove. Works on a broad swell window from NW through WSW (optimal around W 260-280°), though the period constraint matters more than exact direction—swells need to be under 16 seconds or the energy refracts toward Point Conception. Surfable across most tides (low is fastest and most defined, but mid works well). Rides up to 300 yards on solid winter swells. A longboard haven on average days producing knee-to-waist-high reelers, but transforms into a world-class performance wave when it's really on. Per local pro Conner Coffin: 'When it's on at the top of the Cove it's my favourite place to surf... those waves go all the way to the freeway.' NW winds are offshore.
